* Work with the __movies.txt__ file
* For each movie you have to connect to the following site __**http://www.omdbapi.com/?i=tt3896198&apikey=52d1c7f**__ and write the details to a separate file
* The file can be named as <moviename>.json
* For example, if you want information about __Dabangg__ movie use this URL http://www.omdbapi.com/?i=tt3896198&apikey=52d1c7f&t=Dabangg

* Design using parallel streams to load the movies and invoke the URLs

* Use any HTTP library of your choice
* You can also use plain __UrlConnection__ class
* There are some movies in the list that may not be available in omdb. Create an __errors.txt__ file and add those movies in the list
